abstract: 'I estimate the impact of new housing supply on the local rent distribution,
  exploiting delays in housing completions caused by weather shocks during the construction
  phase. Increasing the flow of new supply by 1% lowers average rents by 0.2%, and
  increases disproportionately the number of second-hand units offered for rent. The
  supply shock affects the entire rent distribution. Employing a quantitative model,
  I explain this pattern by secondary supply: New supply triggers a cascade of moves
  that frees up units in all segments of the local market. The impact on rents is
  similarly strong in locations experiencing growing housing demand.'
