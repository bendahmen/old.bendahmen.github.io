abstract: We measure the capitalization of housing market externalities into residential
  housing values by studying the unanticipated elimination of stringent rent controls
  in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1995. Pooling data on the universe of assessed values
  and transacted prices of Cambridge residential properties between 1988 and 2005,
  we find that rent decontrol generated substantial, robust price appreciation at
  decontrolled units and nearby never-controlled units, accounting for a quarter of
  the $7.8 billion in Cambridge residential property appreciation during this period.
  The majority of this contribution stems from induced appreciation of never-controlled
  properties. Residential investment explains only a small fraction of the total.
