abstract: This paper uses the sudden end of rent control in Massachusetts in 1995
  to estimate the effects of rent control. I examine Boston MSA data from the American
  Housing Survey years 1985--1998 to determine how rent control affected the quantity,
  price and quality of rental housing. My results suggest rent control had little
  effect on the construction of new housing but did encourage owners to shift units
  away from rental status and reduced rents substantially. Rent control also led to
  deterioration in the quality of rental units, but these effects appear to have been
  concentrated in smaller items of physical damage. I also examine specifications
  that allow rent control to affect rent levels both directly through controlled status
  and indirectly through spillover effects from nearby rent controlled units. These
  estimates imply that rent control may have small effects on the price of the non-controlled
  rental housing stock.
