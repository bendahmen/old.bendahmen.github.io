abstract: Second generation rent control seeks to prevent negative quantity effects
  by exempting newly built units. The artificially lowered rent in the controlled
  segment makes renting attractive for households that would otherwise not have rented
  in the market, replacing households with higher willingness to pay for housing.
  These households bid up prices in the free market segment, giving rise to an opposite-sign
  spillover from the controlled to the free market (Mense, Michelsen, and Kholodilin
  2017). This paper documents a positive effect of \"second generation\" rent control
  on the value of vacant, buildable land.
