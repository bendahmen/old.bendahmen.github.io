abstract: Using a 1994 law change, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in the
  assignment of rent control in San Francisco to study its impacts on tenants and
  landlords. Leveraging new data tracking individuals' migration, we find rent control
  limits renters' mobility by 20 percent and lowers displacement from San Francisco.
  Landlords treated by rent control reduce rental housing supplies by 15 percent by
  selling to owner-occupants and redeveloping buildings. Thus, while rent control
  prevents displacement of incumbent renters in the short run, the lost rental housing
  supply likely drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the
  goals of the law.
